      <h1>About Defold</h1>
	  <p><img src="images/editor.png" width="400" height="267" align="right" alt="Defold IDE">Defold is an IDE for the Lua programming language and is ideal for games development. Used by professional and indie studios, it's a proven tool for developing games of all genres. Defold is built and used by &quot;King&quot;, the studio  famous for  Candy Crush Saga. A game that earned the studio over $3.9 billion, being one of the most popular game of all time. Defold is used by more than 40,000 developers worldwide and is a great stepping stone to other industry standard game development tools including Unreal and Unity.</p>
	  <p>The finished code can be run on PC, or translated to web and mobile devices. You could even monetise a game developed in Defold by publishing it on the Apple Appstore, Google Play or Facebook Canvas, including in-app purchases! Defold also supports third party libraries to extend the functionality of the IDE further.</p>
	  <h1>Why learn Defold?</h1>
	  <p>The Defold IDE gives you a solid framework for games development, but leaves you plenty of room to create complex algorithms too. With Defold you are able to create a highly polished game using industry standard techniques that are suitable for your level of study. Games development has an ideal level of complexity for Computer Science programming projects and it is fun!</p>
	  <h1>How do I start?</h1>
	  <p>Use the <a href="02-tutorials.html">tutorials</a> on this site to learn the Defold IDE and Lua. Each tutorial introduces new concepts, plus some additional challenges for you to develop the skeletal programs further. The tutorials built into Defold will also show you the basics, but don't start the games from a blank canvas so you will probably find the tutorials on this site enable you to become a game developer more quickly with less frustration!</p>
	  <p>The <a href="03-helpsheets.html">help pages</a> provide you with a quick reference guide for   techniques you learn in the tutorials. These will show you how to tackle common games related problems in Defold.</p>
	  <p>Download and include the free-to-use <a href="04-assets.html">graphics and sounds assets</a> to speed up development and add sparkle to your game.</p>
